# If I want to print it like 
# my name is prasad i m 24 years old my height is 5.9 ft i have to use

print("My name is",name,"I am",age,"years old and my height is",height,"ft")

# this will become so messy so that we can use f-string function in python like

print(f"My name is {name} I am {age} years old and my height is {height} ft")
